# unreleased

# 0.3.0

This is the first release for a stable Scala 3 version, and with cats-effect 3 support!

### :warning: breaking
- `pureharm-db-testkit` now depends on cats-effect `3.2.1`, and the corresponding dependencies for it.
- `pureharm-db-testkit-ce2` is binary, and source compatible with `pureharm-db-testkit` from version `0.2.0`, so if you haven't migrated to CE3 yet, use the former module.

### Dependency upgrades
- [pureharm-core](https://github.com/busymachines/pureharm-core/releases) `0.3.0`
- [pureharm-effects-cats](https://github.com/busymachines/pureharm-effects-cats/releases) `0.5.0`
- [pureharm-testkit](https://github.com/busymachines/pureharm-testkit/releases) `0.4.0`
- [pureharm-db-core](https://github.com/busymachines/pureharm-db-core/releases) `0.5.0`
- [pureharm-db-flyway](https://github.com/busymachines/pureharm-db-flyway/releases) `0.6.0`

### New Scala versions:
- `2.13.6`
- `3.0.1`
- drop `3.0.0-RC2`, `3.0.0-RC3`

### internals
- bump scalafmt to `3.0.0-RC6` â€” from `2.7.5`
- bump sbt to `1.5.5`
- bump sbt-spiewak to `0.21.0`
- bump sbt-scalafmt to `2.4.3`

# 0.2.0

### breaking changes:

- upgraded to `pureharm-testkit` 0.3.0` which replaces scalatest w/ munit.
- you have to use `testResource.test("name")` in all your tests to be consistent w/ munit handling of resources.
- `DBTestSetup.flywayConfig` now takes an `implicit logger`, should be source compatible. Updated to copy schema name from the db config by default. Since most likely it's wrong if the schema name is different between the two configs.
